The lego database
Ashton Spykerman St10486273
The goals of this website is to allow users to find lego sets based on the genre they are looking for out there on the web instead of
having to search multiple sites, this is the work in progress version of the website and is not 
fully complete with all of the functions, i would like to add links at a later date to allow for users to find the sites more easily
